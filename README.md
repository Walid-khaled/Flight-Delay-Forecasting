## Flight Delay Forecasting (Machine Learning-Assignment1)
This repository contains an implementation for Flight delay forecasting using different machine learning models such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularizing based on lasso regression.<br>
Task discription is attached.<br>
Documentation file is also attached.<br>

### Pre-processing Stage
The pre-processing stage contains the following:
1. data exploration
2. splitting the data into train and test sets
3. resetting index
4. One hot encoding
5. missing values check function
6. feature scaling
7. data visualization

#### Then uncomment the part for outliers detcetion and removal to get the second plot after removing outliers. 

#### Finally, uncomment each model seperately to get its output and the train and test error through the evaluation mertics.
