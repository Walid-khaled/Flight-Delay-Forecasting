# Walid-khaled-Machine-Learning-A1
## This code is an implementation for Flight delay forecasting using different machine learning models such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularizing based on lasso regression. 
## How to run the main file?
### To run the main file properly and observe the results, please first comment all lines realted to models starting from line 113 to the end, in order to explore the results of the pre-processing stage first. You will get the output of:
#### 1. data exploration
#### 2. splitting the data into train and test sets
#### 3. resetting index
#### 4. One hot encoding
#### 5. missing values check function
#### 6. feature scaling
#### 7. data visualization

### Then uncomment the part for outliers detcetion and removal to get the second plot after removing outliers. 

### Finally, uncomment each model seperately to get its output and the train and test error through the evaluation mertics.
