## Flight Delay Forecasting (Machine Learning-Assignment1)
This repository contains an implementation for Flight delay forecasting using different machine learning models such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularizing based on lasso regression. It is also the solution for Assignment1 in Machine Learning course for ROCV master's program at Innopolis University.<br>
Task description is attached.<br>
Documentation file is also attached.<br>

### Pre-processing Stage
The pre-processing stage contains the following:
1. data exploration
2. splitting the data into train and test sets
3. resetting index
4. One hot encoding
5. missing values check function
6. feature scaling
7. data visualization
---

### Final Stage
- Outlier detection and removal are implemented 
- Different regression models are applied, and a comparison is conducted based on evaluation metrics
